# Ecommerce-headphones-website
A fully functioning front and back end headphones E- commerce website. Including a shopping cart, order list, order history, and multiple user support. The website is coded using html, css, JS, PHP, SQL, and bootstrap techniques. Please keep in mind this was my first ever attempt at a fully functioning E-commerce website and some security features can be better implemented such as salting user passwords rather than hashing them. I would love to work on projects such as these in the future. 


Ahh foolish young coder. This was one of my first php and html big school project. Even though it's poorly structured, it's 100% working with expected functionality working as it should. Crazy to see how far you've come when looking at one of your first projects. 

Happy coding!
